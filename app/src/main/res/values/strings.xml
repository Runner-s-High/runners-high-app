"Stressed out and want to go for a run?\n\n
Use Runner\'s High to track your run and your mood at the same!\n\n
When starting a run workout, the app will ask you your mood. Then just run like normal.
You can keep tabs on your progress with statistics and live location tracking.
Once the run is completed, fill out your new mood and feel free to look back over your
previous runs as well.\n\n
We hope this app treats you well, and enjoy your runs!\n\n
